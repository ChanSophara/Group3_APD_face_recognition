About this model: Advanced In-Memory Augmentation
All augmentation happens in RAM/memory

Original data stays clean: Your data/ folder remains unchanged

Smart strategies: Different augmentation intensity based on image count:

1-9 images → Maximum augmentation (25+ variations per image)

10-19 images → Extreme augmentation (10+ variations per image)

20-39 images → Very strong augmentation (8+ variations per image)

40-49 images → Strong augmentation (4+ variations per image)

50-99 images → Moderate augmentation (2-3 variations per image)

100+ images → Uses existing images with minimal augmentation

Better augmentations: Includes rotations, perspective warps, lighting changes, noise addition

Cleaner: No duplicate files created anywhere





this model will likely give you better results because:

More sophisticated augmentations (not just duplicates)

Adaptive strategy based on how much data you have

Simulates real-world variations (lighting, angles, noise)

For example:

If you have only 5 images of John, Option 1 creates 100 diverse variations

If you have 50 images of Alice, Option 1 creates about 100 smart variations

If you have 100+ images of Bob, Option 1 uses them with minimal changes
